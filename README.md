# arkanoid.cpp

A modern C++ implementation of the classic **Arkanoid** game.

## üïπÔ∏è Play

### ‚å®Ô∏è Controls

The racket will follow the mouse movement. And, there are the following key bindings:

- `q`, `<esc>` - Quit the game
- `r` - Restart the current level
- `<space>` - Release the ball or shoot the laser

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- Check [configs.cppm](./configs.cppm) for the game configuration options.
- Check [level.txt](./ressources/level.txt) for building your own levels.
  - Note that the bricks coordinates are relative to the bottom-left corner of the screen.
  - And make sure they are adjusted to the `size`'s defined in [configs.cppm](./configs.cppm).

## üéØ Roadmap

- [x] Basic gameplay
- [x] More bricks types
  - [x] Silver Bricks: breakable only with multiple hits
  - [x] Gold Bricks: unbreakable
- [x] Bonus pills
  - [x] Slow Ball
  - [x] Extra Life
  - [x] Wide Racket
  - [x] Sticky Racket
  - [x] Split Ball
  - [x] Laser

## üêõ Known Issues

- [ ] Only the ball can actively bounce, which may cause the ball to enter the racket and bounce between its top and bottom surfaces from inside.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

This project is easy to build and run with modern tools like `xmake`.
